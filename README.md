# gsoc-2018

This repository is for tracking TEAMMATES' activities in GSoC 2018. The primary purpose is for the students to update their progress and plan on a daily basis, and for the mentors to verify/validate those progresses/plans.

The following workflow should be observed:
- Students
  - Submit all updates via PR
    - PR title: `Week X Progress Update: Your Name`
  - Work with your mentors to adjust your plan, and communicate any difficulty you faced
- Mentors
  - Verify that all the progress reported by the student is valid
  - Validate the action plan for feasibility; help the student with planning whenever necessary
  - If everything is OK, approve the PR and merge it immediately

Format of progress report:
- Past weeks:
  - Plan: The original plan
    - Tick the items that are achieved
    - Leave the items that are not achieved unticked (do not remove)
    - Do not include any achieved item that is not part of the original plan; they can be claimed for credit under "Works"
  - Works: The concrete works/PRs
    - Merged PRs should be included
    - Important ongoing PRs that is close to merging can also be included
  - Retrospect: Your retrospect on how the week goes, e.g. difficulties faced
- Current and subsequent weeks: List of items to do
